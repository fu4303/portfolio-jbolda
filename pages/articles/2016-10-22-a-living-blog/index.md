Hello everyone! I am setting up a sort of quasi-blog that I can present various calculators. You may also find some productivity hacks and thoughts on my travels. I am a structural engineer by trade with an interest in finance, business and programming. Feel free to learn more about my story at my about page or contact me with any questions.
